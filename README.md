# Pitch Type Prediction Model

## Overview

The primary goal of this project was to build a model that predicts the likelihood of a player seeing a specific pitch type in the coming year. This prediction leverages both the percentage of that pitch type a player received and their performance metrics against it from the current year. By analyzing historical data, the model aims to provide insights that can assist players and coaches in strategizing for the upcoming season.
